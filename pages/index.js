          Duothan 3.0 is a buildathon organized by the IEEE Student Branch of
          NSBM. This event is not just an ordinary buildathon. The specialty is,
          we are going to conduct this event in association with Valentines'
          Day, and the competitors have to build in two pairs. Each team needs
          04 members and they will get a time period of 07 hours. The buildathon
          is taking place as a Physical event, not only for NSBM Green
          University students but also for undergraduates from any university
          and all the participants will receive a digital certificate upon
          completing the buildathon under the standards of the event. This is a
          great opportunity to stand a chance to win exciting cash prizes as a
          team.
